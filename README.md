# Sweet and Treats Landing Page
## Project Overview
This project is centred around a user-friendly landing page for a bakery. It involves HTML and CSS to create a dynamic webpage that includes all important information about Sweet and Treats Bakery. I focused on accessibility as well and therefore have made the page easy to navigate for everyone. This project highlights 
my ability to design websites that follow accessibility guidelines, provide customers with important information, and made sure the website meets industry standard.
